Is Northeastern Open?       ...well, is it?


Developed on a whim one Wednesday night in February 2017 after a friend suggested the idea, this whimsical website is meant for Northeastern students to visit during the winter when the chance of classes being canceled is highest. It was built to jokingly mirror [isnortheasternclosed.com](http://isnortheasternclosed.com/) - which was created by a former Northeastern student.  

This website gave me a chance to further explore AWS's web hosting capabilities, as the files are hosted in an S3 bucket and the rest is handled by Route53.  In the future, I plan to give the site a backend so it can autonomously change depending on whether or not the school is open.
